This would initialize the matrix in a way that when used as a transform results in a width of 0, which is hardly ever useful. I'd except it to be initialized as such:

```
class B2Mat22
{
    public function new ()
    {
        col1 = new B2Vec2(1.0, 0);
        col2 = new B2Vec2(0, 1.0);

Is it a manual port or is it transpiled? I'm asking because making specific changes will make it much harder to maintain if it is the latter :/

So my findings are, that first compilation error is just an order of definitions issue. Line 72 just doesn't know about the constant it is using yet.

 After fixing this, there are numerous runtime errors, that I have seemed to boil down to one simple thing. This library is expecting `null` to be coerced to `0` in quite a few operations involving mainly bitmasks and increments from what I can see.

I just kept stomping them and making sure a `0` was defined where these operations failed with `null`.

With that the openfl sample works on neko.

Your thoughts?

I was trying box2d buoyancy example as3 in openfl but unable to find any alternate method for this ""circDef.b2internal::m_p.Set(30 / m_physScale, 0 / m_physScale);"".

bodyDef.position.set(300/ m_physScale, 300 / m_physScale);
            body = m_world.createBody(bodyDef);
            circDef = new B2CircleShape(7 / m_physScale);
            fd = new B2FixtureDef();
            fd.shape = circDef;
            fd.density =2;
//          circDef.computeMass(30 / m_physScale, 0 / m_physScale);
//          circDef.B2internal:m_p.set(30 / m_physScale, 0 / m_physScale);
            body.createFixture(fd);
//          circDef.B2internal::m_p.set(-30 / m_physScale, 0 / m_physScale);
            body.createFixture(fd);
//          circDef.B2internal::m_p.set(0 / m_physScale, 30 / m_physScale);

                body.createFixture(fd);

By commenting the b2internal call I am able to run example but water is not interacting with bodies at all.

Another problem within the same example, the last few line are:

```
for(body in m_bodies){
    m_controller.addBody(body);
}           
m_world.addController(m_controller);
```

last line hangs the example and do not show anything in flash player/browser(crashes). What I believe it may be due to the fix I did yesterday in haxe/lib/box2d/1,2,0/box2D/dynamics/controllers/B2BuoyancyController.hx

Without the fix it was throwing following error, ""on line 95: Unexpected character ;""

```
/usr/lib/haxe/lib/box2d/1,2,0/box2D/dynamics/controllers/B2BuoyancyController.hx:95: characters 39-40 : Unexpected ;
/usr/lib/haxe/lib/box2d/1,2,0/box2D/dynamics/controllers/B2BuoyancyController.hx:95: characters 39-40 : Unexpected ;
```

I used, while on that line instead of ""for loop"":

```
while(i.nextBody)
```

Then the same error moved to line 109

I used, while on it:

```
while(fixture.getNext())
```

Then it moved to 137 and 146, there were semi-colons missing. So i added them...
I think i didn't fix it the right way :(
