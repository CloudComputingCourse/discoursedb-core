# Web UI for DIscourseDB annotation

This user interface showcases the capabilities of DiscourseDB's annotation subsystem and allows a user to retrieve data and annotate it and save it back to DiscourseDB.

The project uses the [Frontend Maven Plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin) to to manage and obtain frontend libraries. The frontend libraries and their versions are defined in [package.json](https://github.com/DiscourseDB/discoursedb-annotation-ui/blob/master/src/main/resources/static/package.json) and will be automatically downloaded by maven using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).
