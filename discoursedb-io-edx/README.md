# DiscourseDB IO edX
This project provides converters for edX data dumps. Right now, discoursedb-io-edx can import discussion forum data into a DiscourseDB instance. Support for other parts of the edX data dumps will be added to this project in the future. Converters for other sources than edX will have their own discoursedb-io-* projects.
